								Keith Alan Barthel was raised on a cattle-ranch
								in the SandHills of Nebraska. He learned the
								values of hard work, importance of agriculture,
								predator control and the preservation of the
								land. As he continued on the path of agriculture
								he worked at feedlots and ranches where his
								wisdom and knowledge on raising cattle grew. He
								learned the importance of vaccines to prevent
								illnesses and the different antibiotics to treat
								illnesses for their different diseases.

								Alan met his wife (Jan Snider) at Western Bible
								College where they got married in 1979. They
								decided that those important values needed to be
								continued. They decided that they wanted to grow
								their own angus cattle herd and share those
								values with others. They operate their ranch
								knowing they must share and instill the
								importance of a good work ethic, raising cattle
								and horses with their children, Brittany and
								Austin.

								The Barthel family operate their angus cattle
								herd between Colorado and Nebraska ranches. They
								use a combination of registered Quarter Horses
								to manage these cattle. They implement Beef
								Quality Assurance practices in order to raise
								the cattle in a low stress environment. By using
								these practices they are able to produce a
								valuable product that feeds families all over
								Colorado and Nebraska.

								Being a Christ centered family, they have
								learned how important it is to share their faith
								with others. They believe that the Bible is the
								Word of God. They believe that Jesus was God in
								the flesh, lived a sinless life, was crucified
								for the atonement of sins, and was resurrected
								from the dead and lives today. With this belief,
								they choose to be witnesses in their community
								reflecting the truth of what Jesus did for them.
